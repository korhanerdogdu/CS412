# CS412 Machine Learning (Spring 2024-2025)

This repository contains my homework assignments and project work for the **Machine Learning** course at Sabancƒ± University.  
The course explores both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of machine learning, including supervised learning, deep learning, and ensemble methods.  
All assignments and projects were implemented using tools such as **Python (Colab)** or **Matlab**, focusing on both correctness and interpretability.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Understand key concepts, assumptions, and limitations of machine learning (e.g., overfitting, bias-variance trade-off, curse of dimensionality, error measures).
- Develop working knowledge of supporting mathematics (probability, expectation, entropy, linear algebra) and algorithmic foundations of common machine learning techniques.
- Apply, implement, and evaluate standard machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, SVMs, neural networks) on real or synthetic datasets.
